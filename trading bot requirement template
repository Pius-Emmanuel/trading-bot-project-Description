•	ZERO lag MACD including histogram 
•	Stochastic Oscillator 



 
Long Trades
Opening a Position 
All the signals below must be true to open a long position.


•	SMA 26 must be greater than SMA 12 
•	EMA 50 must be greater than SMA 12 
•	EMA 100 must be greater than SMA 12 
•	MACD Zero-Lag line must be greater than MACD SIGNAL line
•	MACD Zero-Lag line must be higher than 0 in value (OPTIONAL)
•	MACD Crossover line must be greater than MACD SIGNAL line
•	MACD Crossover line must be higher than 0 in value (OPTIONAL)
•	Stochastic %K periods must be greater than %D periods
•	Stochastic %K periods? must be less than 20
Closing a Position

Close long as soon as 1 of these signals happen; no matter which one the trade will close.


1.	MACD Zero-Lag SIGNAL line is greater than MACD line
2.	MACD Zero-Lag line becomes lower than 0 in value (OPTIONAL)
3.	%K period is less than %D periods
4.	%K period is greater than 80
5.	Close short trade if zero lag MACD line value gets lower than MACD histogram value 
a.	(OPTIONAL) – Activates (Stop trading rules) 
6.	Close short trade if zero lag MACD TRIGGER line value gets lower than MACD histogram value
a.	(OPTIONAL) – Activates (Stop trading rules)
7.	Stop Loss
a.	Activates (Stop trading rules)
8.	Take Profit
a.	Activates (Stop trading rules)


LONG SL/TP and manual close of trades (RULES)

To get permission to open a new long trade ONE of the following things must become true first.

1.	MACD Zero Lag SIGNAL line becomes bigger than MACD line (NOT OPTIONAL)



 
Short Trades
Opening a Position 
All the signals below must be true to open a short position.

•	SMA 26 must be less than SMA 12
•	EMA 50 must be less than SMA 12

•	MACD Zero-Lag line must be less than MACD SIGNAL line
•	MACD Zero-Lag line must be lower than 0 in value (OPTIONAL)
•	Stochastic %K periods must be less than %D periods
•	Stochastic %K periods? must be greater than 80

Closing a Position

Close long as soon as 1 of these signals happen; no matter which one the trade will close.


1.	MACD Zero Lag SIGNAL line becomes smaller than MACD line
2.	MACD Zero Lag line becomes higher than 0 in value (OPTIONAL)
3.	%K period is greater than %D periods
4.	%K period is less than 20
5.	Close short trade if zero lag MACD line value gets higher than MACD histogram value 
a.	(OPTIONAL) – Activates (Stop trading rules) 
6.	Close short trade if zero lag MACD TRIGGER line value gets higher than MACD histogram value
a.	(OPTIONAL) – Activates (Stop trading rules)
7.	Stop Loss
a.	Activates (Stop trading rules)
8.	Take Profit
a.	Activates (Stop trading rules)


SHORT SL/TP and manual close of trades. (RULES)
