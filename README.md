Project Description

A clear project description will help keep the costs down for you, as it is able to shorten the developing time. It also ensures you get the project you have in mind right away without several revisions.
If the description is not very clearly defined or the programming request is complex, then it will not be possible to provide you with our fixed flat fee and an accurate turnaround time. This would also mean the pricing for your project would need to be based on whatever time it takes billed on an hourly rate basis.
This project description document will be attached to your invoice as part of terms & conditions so please make sure you update this document if you request additional changes.

You can copy & paste here, but the more information you provide the lower your quote will be.
